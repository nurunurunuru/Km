# AI Recruiter — Voice Screening Platform

A full recruitment platform with two portals:

- **Admin dashboard** — post jobs (with AI auto-fill), review AI-scored applications,
  approve candidates for interview, read AI-generated interview reports, and make the
  final hire/reject call.
- **Candidate portal** — browse open jobs, apply with a resume, see an instant AI match
  score, and (once approved) take a real AI voice interview right in the browser.

## How the workflow works

1. **Admin posts a job.** Type just a job title and click **AI Auto-fill** — Gemini
   writes the full description, requirements, responsibilities, skills, and a
   suggested salary range. Everything is editable before publishing, or you can skip
   AI and write it all yourself.
1b. **Admin sets the interview question set** for that job — click **AI Auto-fill
   Questions** to have Gemini draft 6 role-specific questions from the job details, add
   your own manually, or edit/remove any of them before publishing.
2. **Candidate registers and applies.** They browse `/portal/jobs`, pick a role, and
   paste their resume text. Gemini immediately compares it against the job and stores
   a **match score (0–100%)** plus a summary of strengths/gaps.
3. **Admin reviews AI-scored applicants** on `/candidates`. Each card shows the match
   %, the AI's analysis, and two buttons: **Approve & Send Interview Invite** or
   **Reject**.
4. **Approving sends a real email** (via Gmail SMTP) with a link to the candidate's
   personal interview room.
5. **Candidate takes the interview** at `/portal/interview/[id]` — the existing
   Vapi-powered `RecruiterVoiceAgent` widget asks exactly the questions set for that
   job (see "Setting up the Vapi assistant" below). When the call ends, the transcript
   is sent to the server.
6. **Gemini writes a structured interview report** (overall score, communication vs.
   technical scores, strengths, concerns, per-skill ratings, recommendation) that
   appears on the candidate's card and in Call History.
7. **Admin makes the final call** — Move to Office Interview (hired) or Reject — and
   the candidate is emailed automatically either way.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the values below
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push     # sync schema to MongoDB
npm run db:seed        # creates an admin + demo candidate + sample jobs
npm run dev
```

### Required environment variables (`.env`)

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | MongoDB connection string |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` / `NEXTAUTH_URL` | NextAuth session signing |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_API_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID` | Voice interview widget ([dashboard.vapi.ai](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Resume matching, AI job auto-fill, interview reports ([aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), free tier works) |
| `GMAIL_USER`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | Sends interview invite / rejection / hired emails via Gmail SMTP. Requires 2-Step Verification + an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Used to build the interview link in invitation emails |

If `GEMINI_API_KEY` or the Gmail vars aren't set yet, the app still works — applications
are just saved without a match score / without sending the email, and errors are logged
server-side instead of crashing the request.

### Setting up the Vapi assistant to ask job-specific questions

Each job now has its own interview question set (added manually by the admin, or
generated with the **AI Auto-fill Questions** button on the job form). For the AI voice
interviewer to actually ask *those* questions instead of generic ones, your Vapi
assistant's system prompt must reference them using Vapi's variable syntax:

1. Go to [dashboard.vapi.ai](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) → your assistant → **Model** tab
2. Set the system prompt to something like:
   ```
   You are a friendly AI recruiter conducting a voice screening interview with
   {{candidateName}} for the {{jobTitle}} position.

   Ask the candidate the following questions, one at a time. Let them fully answer
   before moving to the next question, and ask a brief natural follow-up if their
   answer is very short:

   {{questions}}

   After all questions are answered, thank the candidate warmly and end the call.
   ```
3. Save the assistant.

The app sends `candidateName`, `jobTitle`, and a numbered `questions` list as Vapi
`assistantOverrides.variableValues` on every call, so the same assistant automatically
asks different questions for every job and candidate — no need to create a separate
Vapi assistant per job.

### Demo accounts (from `npm run db:seed`)

- Admin: `admin@recruiter.com` / `admin123`
- Candidate: `candidate@example.com` / `candidate123`

New candidates can also self-register at `/register`.

## Routes

| Path | Who | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/login`, `/register` | Everyone | Auth |
| `/dashboard`, `/jobs`, `/candidates`, `/calls` | Admin only | Manage jobs, review AI scores, approve/reject, view interview reports |
| `/portal/jobs` | Candidate only | Browse & apply to open roles |
| `/portal/applications` | Candidate only | Track application status |
| `/portal/interview/[id]` | Candidate only | Take the AI voice interview once approved |

Route access is enforced both in `middleware.ts` (redirects) and in each layout/tRPC
procedure (`adminProcedure` / `candidateProcedure`), so the two roles can never see
each other's pages or call each other's API routes.
